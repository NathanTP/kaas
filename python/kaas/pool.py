    of workers. Worker groups are the unit of isolation in the Pool. They are

    group. Once registered, users may request work via run(). The Pool ensures
    that a worker is running for each request and may kill existing workers to
    make room. The exact Pool behavior is defined by the Policy. While users
    can invoke different methods on the workers, it is good practice to limit
    workers to only one predictable behavior so that policies can optimize for
    worker properties.

    How this is different from Ray Actors and Tasks:
        You can think of the Pool as an interface to customize Ray's workers.
        Unlike tasks, workers can opportunistically cache data between requests
        to ammortize initialization costs. Unlike Actors, workers are not
        directly addressable and may be killed at any time. Multiple Policies
        may be implemented to provide more or less isolation between worker
        types and other fairness properties.
